# Book Search Engine

## Description

This project is all about refactoring a fully functional Google Books API search enginge built with RESTful API to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. I have set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the exsisting RESTful API. The existing authentication middleware has been modified so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API. I have created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. Lastly, this has been deployed to Heroku and the link is provided below in resources.
